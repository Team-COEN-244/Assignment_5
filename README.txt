This code is an update to the Fig.10.10 and Fig10.11 from the textbook.
The user just has to enter the values of 5 integers corresponding to an array of size 5.
Then he/she has to enter 5 doubles to create an array of 5 doubles.
Finally it will be ask to enter 5 strings.
All arrays will be written in a txt file named Template.txt and the user will be able to see its output in the program or by opening the txt file.

Thanks for using our program !
